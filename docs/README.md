# Lab Automation Project

## Idea 

Treat your Servers like Cattle'S, **NOT** like Pets. That means:
* No loving and caring
* Replaceable ASAP

* Speed
* Replicate

## Proof of Concept

* [AutomatedLab](https://github.com/AutomatedLab) PowerShell Module
* [Polaris](https://github.com/powershell/polaris) PowerShell Module

## Advantages

* Time saving - Faster lab builds and configuration
* Reusability - Every Automation creates a script file that can be reused.
* Modular & Segregated - Easy to delete\rebuild with Automation.
* Highly Configurable - PowerShell can control almost any aspect of Servers configuration.
* Accessibility - Web form is accessible from any machine on same network.
